# Sport Animation Overview
A web application framework to visualize sports as a animation of player tracker data. This branch was adapted from the master to read in the slightly altered data fromat provided by [NFL Big Data Bowl 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/overview). To see a live version of this, you may try visiting this link, although if it is not responding, feel free to reach out to me as a I don't keep the ec2 instance it runs on up at all times.

## Installation and Use
To try running this code, simply clone the repo, and ensure you have the libraries listed in the requirements.txt already in your local python environment, or as a part of a virtualenv. You will just need to edit `line 10` of the `app.py` file, to change the pointer for `data_file_path`. Additionally, you will need to run the `split_week_into_game_plays` in [the big_data_bowl_2021](https://github.com/hatfieldm48/sports_animation/blob/big_data_bowl_2021/big_data_bowl_helper_nb.ipynb) script which will break out the `weeks[i].csv` data files into individual tracking csv data files for each play of each game. The process for commented in cell 3 in the notebook.

From the cloned directory, running `python app.py` will create a local flask webapp where you can choose between these sample games, and then scroll through all the plays of that game to see each individual play animation.

If you would prefer to run this without docker, you can refer back to the commit `` of this branch

## What it Looks Like
Take a look at the [wiki homepage](https://github.com/hatfieldm48/sports_animation/wiki) to see a gif video of what the animation looks like. You can hover over a player's icon to see the name. You can also click on that player to display a full play track of their location, along with a visualization of the closest player from the opposing team to them at all times.
